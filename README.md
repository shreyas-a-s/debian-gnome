# Debian-Gnome
Bash script to install minimal version of gnome on debian

## Acknowledgements
- Thanks, [tukusejssirs](https://gitlab.com/tukusejssirs) for gshort.sh script.

## Prerequisites
Debian minimal install using [netinstall iso](https://debian.org/download) with no DE installed is prefered even though the script will work even if DE is installed.

## Installation

Execute install.sh as **normal user** from a terminal:

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/shreyas-a-s/debian-gnome.git
 cd debian-gnome/
 .install.sh
```

For those who would like a single-line command:
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/shreyas-a-s/debian-gnome.git && cd debian-gnome/ && ./install.sh
```
